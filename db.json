They give you ​an opportunity to ​connect with, ​present​ ​to ​and ​educate our members and guests​ about who you are, what you do and why you’re different​. You can also actively ​request introductions to specific people you'd like to meet or for general referrals. You will be accessing the extended networks of our members - potentially thousands of people.\n\nSince Covid-19, like everyone, we have moved our meetings online. Previously we met in person at the Brighton Yacht Club over breakfast (check out our great video above!). Whilst we can't wait to get back there and enjoy our beachside breakfast views, our Zoom meetings still have the same amazing buzz with loads of referrals, business and 1:1 meetings happening every week.. Now more than ever you can't afford to be losing connections you would have normally made face to face. BNI has embraced online networking, so come and join us!",
